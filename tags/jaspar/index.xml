      <description>JASPAR is an open-access database of transcription factor binding profiles across multiple species in six taxonomic groups. It was first developed by Albin Sandelin during his Ph.D. at Karolinska Institutet, Sweden in 2004. JASPAR is an extremely useful resource for transcriptional gene regulation community, and it has been widely used and cited (&amp;gt;4,000 citations).
Since then JASPAR database has been extensively updated almost every second year. For the seventh release of JASPAR, I got involved to redevelop the entire database including its features and user interface.</description>

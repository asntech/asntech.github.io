      <description>In early 2018, I became the eLife Ambassador along with more than 150 others to work to catalyse improvements in the way science is communicated and performed. I have joined the initiatives, with focus on;
 Science communication, publishing, funding, open access, open science, preprints, and reproducibility
 In the funding initiative, the eLife Ambassadors created a comprehensive Excel sheet of funding schemes and opportunities for postdocs and early career researchers.</description>

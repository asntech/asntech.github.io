      <description>ECRcentral is a central platform for early career researchers to find research fellowships and travel grants, and to share experiences, resources and feedback.
ECRcentral is a community-driven initiative which was started by eLife Ambassadors 2018. The eLife Ambassador program supports the development of new initiatives ranging from preprints, reproducibility, and funding, by facilitating local discussions and connecting communities with international developments. We invite you to join and contribute by adding/editing funding opportunities.</description>
